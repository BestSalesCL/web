            training, designed by highly qualified coaches using the BESTLEVEL
            methodology. The planning can be modified weekly according to the

            be considered to adjust the planning. For proper planning, the
            client must describe in advance the sports facilities they have
            access to and all the equipment available for exercise, including
            areas and materials enabled for training. Additionally, a monthly
            report on improvements, observations, and projections for the next
            mesocycle will be provided. We reserve the right to present the

            habits, goals, and restrictions of each user. Currently, we do not

            improvements in performance and health. BestLevel selects
            nutritionists ensuring high quality and benefit for the clients, but
            is not responsible for the specific content of the nutrition plans,
            as these are entirely developed and managed by the qualified

            <br />
            Begins with a thorough evaluation where our experienced team
            analyzes the client&apos;s individual capabilities. The client must
            provide information about the infrastructure and equipment they have
            access to so the staff can plan their training. Based on the
            collected data, a personalized mesocycle training plan is designed
            specifically tailored to the client&apos;s goals. At the end of each
            four-week cycle, a detailed monthly report will be provided the
            following week, using the BEST LEVEL method, a scientific
            methodology that quantifies training variables to measure

          <p className="text-16 text-text_400">
            The warranty is valid for the first 3 months of training. To claim
            the warranty, the client must record themselves using the app to
            perform each exercise of the training, documenting that the method
            did not work and having strictly followed each scheduled training
            session. The warranty covers physical results, and if the client
            does not improve, they may request a refund. Injuries, nutrition
            services, and any other services besides personalized training are
            not covered. The client must upload all training and exercise videos
            recorded on the training day through the app and make the claim
            within 15 days after the end of the third month. The company will
            refund 110% of the service value within an agreed-upon timeframe.
            The warranty applies only to personalized training services and
            requires the client to strictly follow the program for three months
            and record all exercises. If the client fails to fulfill these
            responsibilities or does not make the claim on time, no refund will
            be issued. There are no additional warranties.
